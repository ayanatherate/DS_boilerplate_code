# DS_boilerplate_code
This repo would serve as my collection of long and repetitive code(s) across Data Science projects which better be (Ctrl C+ Ctrl V)-ed. I would add more from time to time. 

P.S. Blindly Ctrl C+ Ctrl V-ing code without understanding how they function, is considered a serious offence under Rule no. 42, Court of Stack Overflow. Jokes aside,
before posting code here, I've made sure that I actually understand them and anyone taking reference from here should, too!
